### Usage
#### The Runner class in the Runners folder is responsible for running the UI part of the test.

1. Go to the Runner Class ("couk/fashionette/Runners/CukesRunner.java")

2. Make sure DryRun = False

3. Negative Test scenario is created to show that screenshots can be taken.

You can choose which Scenarios to run with any name annotation by putting them in front of the Scenarios. You can run the test via Maven-Lifecycle-Verify or from your local shell with maven "mvn correct".
